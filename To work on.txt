To work on:

Ready for Next Features:

User profile pages - Done
Cards; foil doesn't change price - Done
Messaging between users - Done
Order management
Payment integration
Wishlists with notifications
Trade offers system

Production Considerations:
For Payment Integration:

Install Stripe: npm install stripe @stripe/stripe-js
Get Stripe API keys from your Stripe dashboard
Replace mock payment processing with actual Stripe API calls
Add webhook handling for payment confirmations

For Messaging:

Consider adding WebSocket support for real-time messaging
Add push notifications for new messages
Implement file attachments for images

For Orders:

Integrate with shipping APIs (Australia Post, etc.)
Add PDF invoice generation
Implement email notifications for order updates

The system is now fully functional with mock data and ready for production integration with payment providers and shipping services. All three features work together seamlessly - users can complete purchases, track orders, and communicate with sellers all within your marketplace!

Next Steps:
The dashboard is now fully functional with mock data for demonstration. When you integrate it with your backend, it will automatically use real data from your database.
Would you like me to help you with:

Marketplace Browse Page - Where users can browse and filter ALL listings from all sellers
Checkout System - Complete the purchase flow
Messaging System - Allow buyers and sellers to communicate
Wishlist Feature - Let users save cards they want to buy later

Areas That Need Development
High Priority

Checkout System - Currently shows "coming soon"
Order Management - No order tracking/history
Payment Integration - No payment processing
User Dashboard - No way to manage listings after creation
Search/Filter for Listings - Can't browse user listings

Medium Priority

Messaging System - No buyer/seller communication
Image Upload - Currently using Scryfall images only
Wishlist Feature - Mentioned in UI but not implemented
Price Alerts - Mentioned but not implemented
User Ratings/Feedback - Schema exists but no UI

Low Priority/Enhancements

Advanced Search Filters - By price, condition, seller
Bulk Import from Other Platforms - TCGPlayer, Deckbox
Collection Tracking - Personal collection management
Trade System - Card-for-card trading
Mobile App - Currently web-only

Technical Observations
Strengths

Clean component structure
Good error handling in backend
Proper authentication flow
Efficient caching for API calls
Rate limiting for external APIs

Issues to Address

Cart data is client-side only (loses on refresh)
No data validation on listing prices
Missing environment variables setup
Database file is tracked in git (security risk)
JWT secret is hardcoded (should be env variable)

Next Steps Recommendations
Immediate priorities:

Implement checkout flow with order creation
Add a "My Listings" page for sellers
Create a marketplace browse page showing all listings
Implement cart persistence using the database

Would you like me to help you implement any of these features? I can create the code for:

Complete checkout system
User dashboard for managing listings
Marketplace browse page with filters
Payment integration setup
Or any other feature you'd like to prioritize
